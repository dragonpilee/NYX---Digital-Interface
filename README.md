## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
- **Build/Module System**: ES Modules (via `esm.sh` for browser-based development)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- A Google Gemini API Key.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository (or set up your project files):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dragonpilee/nyx-cyberpunk-chatbot.git
    cd nyx-cyberpunk-chatbot
    ```
    If you are not using Git, ensure all the project files (`index.html`, `index.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `types.ts`, `components/*`, `metadata.json`) are in their correct locations.

2. **Configure API Key:**
    This project **requires** the Google Gemini API key to be set as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

    **IMPORTANT**: For this browser-based ES Module setup, `process.env.API_KEY` is typically injected during a build step or by a server. If you are running this directly in the browser without a build process, you'll need to ensure `process.env.API_KEY` is defined in the scope where `App.tsx` is executed.

    For example, you might modify `index.html` to include a script tag *before* your main script:
    ```html
    <script>
      // WARNING: This is for local development/testing ONLY.
      // Do NOT commit your API key to version control.
      // In a real deployment, this should be handled securely by a build process or server.
      window.process = { env: { API_KEY: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" } };
    </script>
    <script type="module" src="/index.tsx"></script>
    ```
    **Remember to remove your API key before committing or deploying!** The ideal way is to have a build process that replaces `process.env.API_KEY`.

3. **Run the application:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. If you are using a local development server (like `live-server` or VS Code's Live Server extension), serve the root directory of the project.

## ü§ñ AI Configuration

The AI's persona ("Nyx") and behavior are configured in `App.tsx`:

- **System Instruction**: The `systemInstruction` within the `ai.chats.create` config guides Nyx's personality and response style.
    ```typescript
    chatRef.current = ai.chats.create({
      model: 'gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17',
      config: {
        systemInstruction: 'You are Nyx, a cyberpunk-themed AI assistant...',
        // thinkingConfig: { thinkingBudget: 0 } // Optional: For lower latency
      },
    });
    ```
- **Initial Message**: The first message from Nyx is set in the `useEffect` hook.

---

## üîß Customization

- **AI Persona**: Modify the `systemInstruction` in `App.tsx` to change Nyx's character, knowledge domain, or response style.
- **Styling**: Update Tailwind CSS classes across components to alter the visual appearance.
- **Model**: You can experiment with other compatible Gemini models by changing the `model` string in `App.tsx`.
